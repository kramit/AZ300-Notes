Register a new account and redeem the code provided by the instrutor

Azure pass for each student is built into the labs

## There are 2 kinds of labs for the course when using LOD labs

### Microsoft provided labs

The Microsoft written labs are taken from the AZ300 Github

https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-300-MicrosoftAzureArchitectTechnologies

These instructions have been intergrated into the LOD lab solution

These labs require the use of an Azure Pass code, a unique Azure Pass code has been intergrated into the labs for each student


### LOD written labs

These are supporting labs written by LOD to expand on the thin content provided by Microsoft for this course.

Theay are called "challenge labs"

They do not require an Azure Pass and when a lab is launched a unique account will be generated by LOD for that single challenge lab

The instructions for the challenge labs are not detailed, you are expected to use your own knowledge and ability to search for solutions and to read documentation to complete the challenges, like you would in the real world.
